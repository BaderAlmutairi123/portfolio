## Overview

An advanced cybersecurity techniques project focused on offensive security research and exploit development. This project covered a wide range of attack vectors and defensive strategies.

## Key Areas

- **Replay Attacks**: Simulated replay attacks and developed custom Metasploit scripts to test and exploit system vulnerabilities
- **Web Application Security**: Exploited command injection and SQL injection flaws to identify critical weaknesses in web applications
- **Memory Analysis**: Conducted memory and core-dump analysis to uncover root causes of system crashes and enhance debugging capabilities
- **Buffer Overflow Techniques**: Explored varieties of buffer overflow techniques, including heapspray attacks, and implemented defense approaches to mitigate exploitation

## Skills Applied

- Metasploit Framework
- SQL Injection & Command Injection
- Memory Forensics & Core Dump Analysis
- Buffer Overflow Exploitation & Mitigation
